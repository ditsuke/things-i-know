The discord video feed seems to act up if the camera has auto-exposure enabled (the case with my current machine -- the Gram 14). To likely fix this, the solution is turning off auto-exposure in the camera settings.

On windows, disabling auto-exposure and adjusting other camera settings could be accomplished with [[ffmpeg-camera-settings|ffmpeg]].
