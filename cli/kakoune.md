Kakoune is an experiment in text editing. It implements a modal text editing model similar to [vim](vim.md) and it written in [C++](c++.md)  by [`mawww`](https://github.com/mawww/).

Kakoune's keybindings are not vim-compatible, aiming to improve on them.

The [helix](helix.md) editor has been inspired by Kakoune.
