> Keeping your system up to date usually involves invoking multiple package managers. This results in big, non-portable shell one-liners saved in your shell. To remedy this, **Topgrade** detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them.

Topgrade is cross-platform, working across Linux, Mac and Windows. Updates packages from multiple managers, including native and language-specific and even frameworks like [[tpm]] for [[tmux]] and [[oh-my-zsh]] for [[zsh]]
