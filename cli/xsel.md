> XSel is a command line or script utility, similar to xclip, that can copy the primary and secondary X selection, or any highlighted text, to or from a file, stdin or stdout. It can also append to and delete the clipboard or buffer that you would paste with the middle mouse button. ([upstream](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/))
