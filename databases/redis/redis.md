# Redis

> _Redis_ is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.

Redis is widely used to speed up applications as a caching layer because of its in-memory nature and support of a wide variety of performant data-structures

It supports rich data structures: (linked-)lists, hashmaps, _sorted-sets_ and some more I'll cover in [[redis-data-structures]], which makes it fit to be used as a broker for task queues and so on (lists can function as stacks and queues).
