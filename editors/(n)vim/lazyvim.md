> LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by [[lazy.nvim]] to make it easy to customize and extend your config.Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.
