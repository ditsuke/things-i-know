> The window bar is a bar that is shown at the top of every window when the winbar option is configured.
> 
> The winbar (:h winbar) option can be either global or local to a window (:h global-local). By default the value is empty.
> 
> When non-empty, the winbar option enables the window bar and determines its contents and the value is evaluated just like the status line (:h ‘statusline’).
