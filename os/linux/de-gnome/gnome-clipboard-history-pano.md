# [[gnome]] Shell and Clipboard History
Having tried several solutions since I started using Gnome again in 2022, my discovery of the Pano shell extension in the November of 203 was a pleasant surprise! Not only does Pano feature a _searchable_ clipboard history, but it also supports context-aware previews and retention for files and images â€“ something I could not find in _any_ extension in my earlier search back in 2022 (which doesn't mean it didn't exist; just that I couldn't find one).
