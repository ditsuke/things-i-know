[[gnome]] gestures, by default, do not work on [[X11]].  It is still possible though, and all we need are two components:
1. [[touchegg]]: https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg#fedora-centos-rhel-and-derivatives
2. [[x11-gestures-gnome-ext]]:  https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4033/x11-gestures/

#todo: customizing these gestures.
