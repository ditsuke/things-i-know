Aliases: Processes on Linux Unexpectedly Dying

#oomd

Processes dying on a Fedora/linux installation in moments of high RAM/SWAP usage? [[oomd]] -- The out-of-memory daemon might be to blame.

[[systemd-oomd]] is a service found on modern distros including [[ubuntu]]. This daemon kills processes matching some criteria in the configuration to free up memory.

As of October 2022, `systemd-oomd` agressively and ruthlessly kills even the Desktop Environment (Gnome, for example), kicking the user out of a running session and butchering all running processes.

Some references:

## Solutions and workarounds
- The first, and recommended way to *fix* a frequently affected system is increasing swap space.
- Second, and unfortunate way is to disable the `systemd-oomd` service altogether with `systemctl mask systemd-oomd`.
