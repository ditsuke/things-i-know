#windows 

If a file/directory cannot be deleted in [[windows]] with an error like "Could not find item", it was probably created through a [[unix]], [[mingw]] or [[msys2]] environment. The simplest way to delete such a node would be through a [[git-bash]] shell or any Unix environment (probably even [[wsl]]).
