> Mypy is a static type checker for [[python]].
> 
> Type checkers help ensure that you're using variables and functions in your code correctly. With mypy, add type hints ([PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)) to your Python programs, and mypy will warn you when you use those types incorrectly.
> 
> Python is a dynamic language, so usually you'll only see errors in your code when you attempt to run it. Mypy is a _static_ checker, so it finds bugs in your programs without even running them!
