> Overmind is a process manager for Procfile-based applications and [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/). With Overmind, you can easily run several processes from your `Procfile` in a single terminal.

Overmind has a _little sister_ in [[hivemind]], which is a lot more streamlined in terms of its feature set.

> How is overmind relevant?

- Manage/organise processes needed by an application, particularly in non-containerized environments.
- On top of what Hivemind already does, Overmind has an integration with [[tmux]] (besides many other features I'm not aware of at the time of writing), which makes for a nice development experience for developers looking to track logs across processes, for example.

> Footnote: I should write more about Overmind and Hivemind when I get around to actually using them.
