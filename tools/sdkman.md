> # The Software Development Kit Manager
> 
> **SDKMAN!** is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple **Software Development Kits** on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. Formerly known as **GVM** the **Groovy enVironment Manager**, it was inspired by the very useful **[RVM](https://rvm.io/)** and **[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)** tools, used at large by the Ruby community.
